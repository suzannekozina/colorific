While working on this project I was discovered "Ruby Constants." I read a post
by Satish Talim on rubylearning.com
[http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_constants.html].

**Mind blown!** How amazing is Ruby!?

The main takeaway from this article for me was that a ruby constant follows many
of the same patterns I'd expect of a ruby variable, but in the case of a
constant its value is intended to remain consistent throughout the program.
Exactly what I was looking for! Ruby rocks!

The other mind-blowing discovery for me was the 'define_method'. I found a few
excellent explanations, but this explanation from Railstic.com
[http://railstic.com/2011/06/dynamically-defining-methods-with-define_method/]
is the one that really hit home for me. The post also introduced me to the
metaprogramming term 'singleton class' which reaped some very interesting Google
search results. I found the singleton pattern,which led me to the Wikipedia
article on Singleton (mathematics), which reminded me of the common core state
standard HSF.IF.1. Then it dawned on me that high school math students are
learning the ruby "each do" pattern in their boring old functions class.

Wow. When I was in high school I learned about functions, just to get an "A' in
the class. But Ruby has made math functions super-cool. Way to go Ruby! :)

Finally, in conjunction with this project, I completed Walter Latimer's
README.md course. It was very helpful when writing the README file for my gem.

Thanks for reading this edition of Suzanne Kozina's reflections.
